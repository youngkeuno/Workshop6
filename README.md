# Workshop6
I created a program that goes through the data in the states file and creates a list with all of the state names. I then made a function that takes in a list of strings and returns the string that would appear last if arranged in alphabetical order. I then made a function that takes in a list of states and returns the highest population that one of those states had. I then made a function that reads through a data csv file and makes a list of lists containing every datum point in the file. I then used that list of lists to create a function that would take it in as an input and return both the name of the state with the highest population and the population itself. I then made a function that takes in the list of lists and appends the population density per state to each list within the overall list. My last function took in the list of lists and returned the state name with the highest population density along with the state itself.
